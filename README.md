# dnd-health-tracker
a health tracker for dnd or other table top games
The way this works is it keeps track of a monsters health relating to tokens on the table top.
There are 5 colors each with a number ranging from 1 through 5 giving 25 different monsters you can keep track of. 
I also added a blank spot with a name field for a custom token
You wwrite the damage or healing at the top of the form and hit the related plus + or minus - button to add or subtract health from the monster.
